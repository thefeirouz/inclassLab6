## Contrast

The number one glaring issue with the original website was the lack of contrast between the components of the websites. I decided to change the background to a light baby blue, and I contrasted that with a yellow. The darker the shade of yellow, the more important I felt the information was. As you scroll through the webpage, the contrast becomes less extreme.

I also added a thick red border to the headings and paragraphs in order to grab the readers attention.


##Readibility
For readability, I added more padding to the text to increase the spacing between the borders. This made it less cluttered.

## Typography

The typefaces I chose were: Aldrich, IBM Plex Mono. I chose both of these fonts to portray the interest Leo had in technology. These fonts were futuristic and computer like. The headings, Aldrich, was a more extreme computer-like typeface. Plex Mono was used for the paragraphs because it was less extreme and more legible for long strings of words.
